                        <br>

                    <p>Barefoot College, an organization developed by Sanjit “Bunker” Roy, is one of many philanthropic efforts aiming to promote self-sufficiency in remote communities. For Roy, basic services, or “barefoot solutions” such as providing the villages health care and education, are used to achieve this end goal.</p>
                    <p>The organization targets unlikely sources to become their agents of change. With the purpose of increasing the usage of electricity in remote villages, grandmothers from regions ranging from Africa to the Himalayas are brought to India by Barefoot College to learn about solar engineering, and are then returned back home.</p>
                    <p>Besides teaching literacy and basic skills, the organization focuses on creating and empowering female leaders.</p>
                    <p>“[The women have] to come out in a situation where [they are] challenged. So we actually create an environment where people can find something within themselves, which they never thought they had… That is how leaders are born,” Roy said.</p>
                    <p>Understanding that men would utilize their newfound skills to scout for job opportunities, the mission exclusively focuses on grandmothers of the rural communities— women who are often in their mid-30’s. After returning with their extensive knowledge and expertise that surpasses that of any other village member, the established male-female relationship is upended forever.</p>
                    <p>“We are engineering a conflict by training a grandmother to be a solar engineer… Politics is about making people think differently,” Roy said.</p>
                    <p>Not only is Barefoot College creating a sustainable method to ensure self-sufficiency in these communities, but it is also transforming the social norm and giving power to the woman.</p>

                    <h2>Stepping Stones to Education
                        <br>
                        <small>August 5, 2017 | Opinion</small>
                    </h2>
                    <p>Imagine stepping into an air conditioned room for your first job interview, an interview that could change your entire world. Your first salary, first laptop, first bag of groceries with your own money. But, you are halted in your tracks as a paper is passed out, with basic requirements for the job, the point topping the list being education. You shrug it off; you are beyond qualified with your degrees </p>
	Stop. Imagine you didn’t have those degrees. Like adorned medals, they are slowly taken away from you, while you stand helplessly, falling to your knees. You turn back, rejected from your job due to a lack of education. Unfortunately, such is the story of multiple individuals who were deprived of a proper education in their youth. Many will argue, saying that an education is not necessary to succeed in life and have a stable job, But education is not about just getting money for survival, yet rather, is about possessing the ability to analyze critical situations, such as reading street signs and the newspaper, writing messages and staying in touch with present day technology. Education has become more critical than ever in the 21st century, and banishing the thought of education only protects the stigma against supporting it. </p>
                    <p>So why do I bring up the importance of education? Education must be a right, and not a privilege. Yet, there are thousands of people who do not have a single medal of education to honor upon themselves, purely due to lack of resources and support. All they can do is wait patiently for help and  for that one person to give them the guidance through the light of education.</p>
                    <p>Luckily, this message is not of one, but many who each and every day advocate for education and literacy for as many individuals as possible. Today, multiple organizations have committed to dedicating themselves towards the pursuit of global education, and to promote the optimistic mindset that with the given support, education can surely be propelled beyond what it is today. This strive for literacy is also seen in the youth of today, who support these organizations by being vocal about their position towards education in these countries and societies who desperately need that support. </p>
                    <p>Let’s rewind back to the job interview. The cool air conditioned wind breezes past your face, as the medals are restored upon you. You get back on your feet, honored with your degrees, and step into the room. The future is held in our hands, for us to restore education to each and every individual who has been deprived of it. Circumstances are unpredictable, our actions are not, and only in united actions can education finally become a right, and not a privilege.</p>

                    <p>Family socioeconomic status severely affects the level of education children receive. According to the American Psychological Association, socioeconomic status includes aspects such as “educational attainment, financial security, and subjective perceptions of social status and social class.” These in turn influence human functioning and mental health.</p>
                    <p>Many children living in poverty do not have the mental strength or willpower to exert themselves in learning environments. Furthermore, schools and other educational facilities in low socioeconomic communities lack the needed resources and qualified personnel to educate these children. Because of this, student dropout rates are significantly higher in low income families. The American Psychological Association reported in 2014 that the high school dropout rate of low income families was on average 12% compared to the 2% of high income families.</p>
                    <p>Not only are resources lacking in impoverished communities, but children are also needed to help support their families at a young age. As a result, many must drop out of school before completing their education contributing to the startling statistic mentioned above.</p>
                    <p>Closing the economic gap requires improved education in low income families. These children need a chance to experience what most other well off children take for granted. Imagine the number of brilliant minds that are suppressed because of the lack of educational opportunities available in low income communities. So what are you waiting for?
